Prometheus Development Alpha

Because I am currently implementing a lot of other things and I am very lazy I didn't
implement a proper command-help system yet. Never the less it would be pretty useless
to implement a lot of features but not give people the knowledge to actually use them
so here is everything you need to know:

First, the config file is in Backend/config.properties, this will change in an actual release
but for now you have to use that to set the downloadfolder.

The flags for search:
-dirsonly           | Only directories are listed
-minsize            | Minimum size of the file, like 1G or 2MB or whatever
-maxsize            | Maximum size of the file, like 2G or 3MB or whatever
-page               | There are 29 results on a page so page n means result n*29 to (n+1)*29

You can open SMB servers with the open command like:
open smb://shokora/
But you can also open a directory from the search results like:
open -s 23

You can download files by going into an SMB server and traveling to the file you need with cd
then there are multiple options. You can either do:
get directory/ or get 4 to get file 4
You can also download a full smb:// url and what you will probably do is download a file from the
search results with:
get -s 12

You can download both files and directories.

Many more features will come :) I aim it to be as flexible as possible


Greetings,

Shokora
